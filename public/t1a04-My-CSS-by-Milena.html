<h2> How birds look very similar to dinos </h2>
    
    
    <p> At about six o'clock in the morning, long before light broke on a cold November day in 2014, I pushed through the Beijing station and fought my way 
      onto a crowded train. I was headed for Jinzhou, a Chicago-sized city in the northeastern fringes of China. I tried to steal back some sleep as we crawled 
      past concrete factories and hazy cornfields, but I was too excited to nod off. Something rumored to be incredible was waiting for me at my destination—a 
      mysterious fossil that a farmer had stumbled on while harvesting his crops.</p> <br>

<p2>Four hours later I stepped onto the platform in Jinzhou, trailing behind my colleague Junchang Lü, a famous dinosaur hunter at the Chinese Academy of Geological 
      Sciences in Beijing who had asked for my help in studying the fossil. A small band of local dignitaries greeted us and whisked us away to the city's museum, 
      a rickety building on the outskirts of town. With the seriousness of a high-level political summit, our party proceeded down a long hallway and into a side 
      room where a slab of rock perched on a small table. It was then that I found myself face-to-face with one of the most beautiful fossils I had ever seen: a 
      skeleton about the size of a donkey, its chocolate-brown bones contrasting with the surrounding gray limestone.</p2> <br> <br> <br>

   <div>
    
<p3>Clearly a dinosaur, the creature had steak knife teeth, pointy claws and a long tail that left no doubt that it was a close cousin of Jurassic Park's villainous 
      Velociraptor. Yet the Chinese specimen differed from such ordinary dinosaurs in important ways. Its bones were light and hollow, its legs long and skinny 
      like a heron's, and its body covered with assorted types of feathers, including big quill pens on the arms, stacked over one another to form wings. This 
  dinosaur bore a striking resemblance to a bird.</p> <br><br><br><br>

     </div>
     <div>
    </div>
    <div>
    
<p4>About a year later Lü and I described this skeleton as a new species, which we called Zhenyuanlong. It is the latest of many feathered dinosaurs found in China's 
      Liaoning Province over the past two decades—a remarkable series of fossils that illustrate, like a flip book, how the monstrous dinosaurs of yore transformed
  into the birds of today.</p4> <br><br><br><br>

<p5>The implications of these fossils are momentous. Ever since Charles Darwin, scientists have wondered how evolution produces radically new groups of animals. Does it
      happen rapidly, the accident of some freak mutation that can turn a land-bound creature into a master of the skies? Or are these new groups forged more slowly,
      as organisms adapt to changing environments over millions of years? Zhenyuanlong and the other fossils from Liaoning and elsewhere are starting to provide an 
  answer.</p5> <br><br><br><br>

<p6>TRANSITIONAL FOSSILS
Birds have a host of features that set them apart from all other modern animals. In addition to traits that enable them to fly, they possess high metabolisms that 
      allow them to grow incredibly quickly and large brains that endow them with high intelligence and keen senses. Birds are so distinctive, in fact, that researchers
  have long puzzled over their origins.</p6> <br><br><br><br>

<p7>In the 1860s English biologist Thomas Henry Huxley—one of Darwin's closest friends and most vociferous supporters—began to figure out the mystery of where birds
      came from. Just a few years after Darwin published On the Origin of Species in 1859, quarry workers in Bavaria split open a limestone slab with the
      150-million-year-old skeleton of a Frankenstein creature inside. It had sharp claws and a long tail like a reptile but feathers and wings like a bird.
      Huxley realized that the beast, dubbed “Archaeopteryx,” bore an uncanny resemblance to small flesh-eating dinosaurs such as Compsognathus that were also 
      starting to come to light at around the same time. So he proposed a radical idea: birds descended from dinosaurs. Others disagreed, and the debate went 
  back and forth for the next 100 years.</p7> <br><br><br><br>

    <div>

<p8>The question was ultimately settled, as these things usually are, by the discovery of new fossils. In the mid-1960s Yale University paleontologist John Ostrom 
      unearthed the astonishingly birdlike dinosaur Deinonychus in western North America. It had long arms that looked almost like wings and a lithe build 
      indicative of an active, energetic animal. Maybe, Ostrom surmised, Deinonychus even had feathers. After all, if birds derived from dinosaurs—which by 
      now many paleontologists were beginning to accept—feathers must have developed somewhere along that evolutionary lineage. But Ostrom could not be sure, 
      because all he had were the creature's bones. Sadly, soft bits like feathers rarely survive the ravages of death, decay and burial to become fossilized.</p8> <br><br><br><br>

<p9> Ostrom waited. He kept looking for the holy grail that would prove beyond any doubt the connection between birds and dinosaurs: dinosaur skeletons preserved in 
      the type of exquisite detail needed to document feathers. Then, in 1996, as his career was drawing to a close, Ostrom was at the annual meeting of the 
      Society of Vertebrate Paleontology in New York City when Philip Currie, now at the University of Alberta, approached him. Currie, who had also been studying
      birdlike dinosaurs, had recently returned from a trip to China, where he caught wind of an extraordinary fossil. He pulled out a photograph and showed it to 
      Ostrom. There it was, a small dinosaur surrounded by a halo of feathery fluff, immaculately preserved because volcanic ash had quickly buried it, Pompeii-style.
  Ostrom began to cry. Somebody had finally found his feathered dinosaur. </p9> <br><br><br><br>

<p10> Feathered dinosaur Zhenyuanlong from Jinzhou, China, is one of many recently discovered fossils that document how birds arose from their terrestrial ancestors to
      conquer the skies. Source: From “A Large, Short-Armed, Winged Dromaesaurid (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from The Early Cretaceous of China and Its Implications for
      Feather Evolution,” by Junchang Lü and Stephen L. Brusatte, in Scientific Reports, Vol. 5, Article No. 11775; July 16, 2015 </p10> <br><br><br><br>

<p11> The fossil that Currie showed Ostrom, later named Sinosauropteryx, opened the floodgates of discovery. Scientists sprinted to the Liaoning region of China where it
      was found, like prospectors in a gold rush, although it was really the local farmers who knew where to look. Today, two decades after the discovery of
      Sinosauropteryx, fossil hunters have recovered more than 20 species of feathered dinosaurs from Liaoning. They run the gamut from nine-meter-long primitive
      cousins of Tyrannosaurus rex coated in hairlike fuzz, to dog-sized herbivores with simple, porcupine-style quills, to crow-sized gliders with full-on wings.
      They are among the most celebrated fossils in the world. </p11> <br><br><br><br>

<p12> The feathered dinosaurs of Liaoning clinched it: birds really did evolve from dinosaurs. But that statement is perhaps a little misleading because it suggests that
      the two groups are totally different things. In truth, birds are dinosaurs—they are one of the many subgroups that can trace their heritage back to the common
      ancestor of dinosaurs and therefore every bit as dinosaurian as Triceratops or Brontosaurus. You can think of it this way: birds are dinosaurs in the same way
      that bats are an aberrant type of mammal that can fly. </p12> <br><br><br><br>

<p13> The Liaoning fossils have also helped untangle the genealogy of birds, revealing where they perch on the dinosaur family tree. Birds are a type of theropod—the same
      group to which ferocious meat eaters typified by behemoths such as T. rex, Allosaurus and Spinosaurus belong. But the very closest relatives of birds are a 
      subset of much smaller, nimbler, brainier theropods: the raptors, which include Velociraptor, Ostrom's Deinonychus and the oh-so-birdlike Zhenyuanlong that
      Lü and I described in Jinzhou. Somewhere within this flock of feathery species lies the line between nonbird and bird. </p13> <br><br><br><br>

<p14> There are now so many feathered dinosaurs from Liaoning and elsewhere that, taken together, they provide the best glimpse at a major evolutionary transition in the
      fossil record. I and other scientists are applying a wealth of cutting-edge techniques to these fossils—computed tomographic scans to visualize anatomy,
      computational analyses for building family trees, computer models of how these animals moved, and advanced statistical techniques to track how evolution 
      produces new species and body plans. Recent insights from these investigations are allowing us to piece together the story of how a dinosaur turned into a 
      bird—keystone evidence for solving that age-old conundrum of how major new groups come to be. </p14> <br><br><br><br>

<p15> ACCIDENTAL LIFTOFF
The origin of feathers is central to the enigma of bird evolution. Feathers are to birds what slicked-back hair and sideburns were to Elvis. A calling card. One 
      glance at the outstretched wings of an eagle or the gaudy tail of a peacock, and you know exactly what you are looking at. It must be a bird because unlike 
      mammals, or reptiles, or any other groups of living animals, only birds have feathers. And what a thing to have. Feathers are nature's Swiss Army knives, 
      multipurpose tools that can enable flight, impress mates or rivals, and retain warmth and brood eggs while an animal sits on a nest. Indeed, they have so many
      uses it has been hard to figure out which purpose they first evolved to serve. </p15> <br><br><br><br>
