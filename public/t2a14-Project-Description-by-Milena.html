Hello this is my game description

I am creating a game were the main charecter has to avoid obstacles. Not find the open area like the flappy bird game. You have to go over and under the obstacle to
avoid it. Meanwhile you need to find a portle to proseed to the next level.




Steps I want to take to animate. 

level 1:
         Have boxes just standing there untill the player reaches the portale.
   
level 2:
        Have more boxes

level 3: 
        Have more boxes and make them move more

Have boxes move from left to right.


*Bonus* Have image change once its out of range
